My main theme in this project was the visualize scientific data.
I used the visualize simulation data which was calculated by super computer GRAPE-5.

The scientific data which I used in here, was the calculation data of 'formation of a spiral galaxy'.
I used maya and 'Zindaiji' in this project.
Zindaiji is the visualize tool for N-Body calculation.

Below movie clip is the sample movie which I create in this project.
